please note you cannot redirect traffic in NLB since it doesnt work on L7 , it cannot open packets and read from it
so if you want to use redirect then you must use an ALB

https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/

AWS load Balancer Controller

ALB supports two modes Instance and IP

Instance Mode:-

Registers nodes/instances/worker nodes within your cluster as targets for ALB
Traffic reaching is routed to nodeport for your service and then proxied to your port
This is the default traffic mode
You can explicitly specify with alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:instance

IP Mode:-

Registers pods as your targets for the ALB
Traffic can reach directly to your pod for your service , reducing the latency
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:ip annotation should be used

when you are using fargate profiles , you must use ip mode incase of application Loadbalancer


while defining the ingress resource , we can do it via the default backend option or via ingress class resource.

kubectl patch ingress ingress-nginxapp1  -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
